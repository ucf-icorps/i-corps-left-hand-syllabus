### Deliverables

Teams will present a 8-minute "Lessons Learned" presentation about what they learned plus a 2-minute YouTube video summarizing their business.

### Presentations: "Lessons Learned"

* Slide 1: Team Name, with a few lines of what your initial idea was and the size of the opportunity.

* Slide 2: Team members – name, background, expertise, and roles on the team.

* Slide 3: Business Model Canvas Version 1 (use the Osterwalder Canvas, do not make up your own): "Here was our original idea."

* Slide 4: "So here’s what we did…" (explain how you got out of the building). 

* Slide 5: "So here’s what we found (what was reality), so then…"

* Etc… Every presentation requires at least three Business Model Canvas slides.

* "So here’s where we ended up." Talk about:

    *  What did you learn?

    * Whether you think this a viable business.

    * Whether you want to pursue it after the class, etc.

* Final Slides: Click through each one of your Business Model Canvas slides.

### Story Structure

 * Storytelling

     * The World: Market/opportunity, how does it operate?

     * The Characters: Customer's/Value Proposition/ product-market fit; pick a few examples to illustrate

     * Narrative Arc: Lessons learned how? Enthusiasm, despair, learning then insight

     * Show us: Images and demo to illustrate  learning = wireframes and pivots to finished product

     * Editing: Does each slide advance the character and plot (learning)

 * Theater

     * Point me at what you want me to see

     * Ought to be self-explanatory

     * Use analogies

### Final Presentation Tips

* You cannot possibly cover everything you learned in ten weeks a 10-minute presentation. Don’t try to. The final presentation is partly an exercise in distilling the most critical, surprising, and impactful things you learned in the process.

* Don’t fall into the trap of making your final presentation too high-level. If it becomes an overview with no details, you will lose the audience and you will look no smarter than day one. We need to see why your Business Model Canvas evolved the way it did. Include anecdotes about specific customer interviews that support the story you are telling.

* If you have a demo, prototype, screenshots, etc., include it in your presentation as a supporting character to illustrate your learning and where it has gotten you (it is called "Lessons Learned Day" and not “Demo Day” for a reason). We are not just interested in what your product is, but why your product is – what did you learn from customers that shaped the product?

### Description of Mandatory 2-minute Video

Create a 2-minute video to be shown at the beginning of your final presentation. The video should summarize the Customer Discovery journey your team went on, highlighting the key customer insights that took you from your initial idea to today. Storytelling quality is critical. High production value is not (some of the best videos have been very straightforward). Also, make it personal—include the team in the video as well as key "aha" moments. This video is about the discovery process. It is not a marketing video for your product. Remember to test the volume of your video. Use speakers, as headphones can be misleading in regards to the production volume.

Here are some resources for creating your video: [videoscribe](http://www.videoscribe.co/), powtoon](https://www.powtoon.com/), and [Vivavideo](http://www.vivavideo.tv/)

Upload the video to YouTube, and link to it from your team’s profile within LaunchPad Central.
