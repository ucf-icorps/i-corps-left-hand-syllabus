### Final Presentations and Video

For the final class, teams will present a 10-minute "Lessons Learned" presentation about what they learned plus a 2-minute YouTube video summarizing their business. This class will be a workshop to prepare you for the final presentation day. Start working on, and create a first draft of your final presentations and 2 minute video. You will present them in class to gather feedback from the teaching team.
