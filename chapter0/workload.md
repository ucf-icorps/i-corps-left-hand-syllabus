## Amount of Work

Teams have reported up to 20 hours of work each week.  Getting out of the classroom is what the effort is about. If you canâ€™t commit the time to talk to customers, this course is not for you. Teams are expected to have completed at least 10 in-person or Skype video interviews each week, focused in the Business Model Canvas area of emphasis for that week.

This means in total over the 4-week course, you will have completed at least 40 interviews. For those with easy to access interview groups, e.g., consumer product/service businesses, more interviews will be expected.
