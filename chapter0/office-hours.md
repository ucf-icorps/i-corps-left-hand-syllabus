## Office Hours

As you read through the material, watch lectures, iterate through your Business Model Canvas, and conduct customer interviews, you will no doubt have many questions. The Teaching Team has set aside time to help each team, and will be conducting Office Hours every week.

This is an opportunity for teams to discuss questions and get clarification on their Business Model Canvas hypotheses, interview customers, lecture material, or anything else related to I-Corps.

Each team is expected to engage in office hours with a member of the Teaching Team *once before every class*. 

* Teams will be provided a link to a signup sheet, where they will be able to choose available time slots to meet with a teaching team member.
