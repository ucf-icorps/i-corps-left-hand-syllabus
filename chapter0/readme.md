# Course Description

This course provides real world, hands-on learning on what it’s like to actually start a company. This course is not about how to write a business plan. It’s not an exercise on how smart you are in a classroom, how well you write code or what your patent is, or how well you use the research library to size markets. The end result is not a PowerPoint pitch deck for a VC "demo day." It is most definitely not an incubator where you come to build the “hot idea” that you have in mind.

This is a practical course – essentially a lab, not a theory or "book" course. Our goal, within the constraints of a classroom and a limited amount of time, is to create an entrepreneurial experience for you with all of the pressures and demands of the real world in an early stage startup. The course is designed to give you the experience of how to work as a team and turn an idea into a company.

You will be getting your hands dirty talking to customers, partners, and competitors, as you encounter the chaos and uncertainty of how a startup actually works. You’ll practice evidence-based entrepreneurship as you learn how to use a business model to brainstorm each part of a company and customer development to get out of the classroom to see whether anyone other than you would want/use your product. Finally, based on the customer and market feedback you gathered, you will use agile development to rapidly iterate your product to build something customers would actually use and buy. Each block will be a new adventure outside the classroom as you test each part of your business model and then share the hard-earned knowledge with the rest of the teams.
