## Peer-to-Peer Comments

While other teams are presenting the results of their weekly experiments, the rest of the teams are expected to attentively listen, engage, and react to what they see and hear. Sharing insights, experience, and contacts with each other is a key way that this unique laboratory achieves results.

All comments by the audience, with the exception of feedback from the Teaching Team, should be placed in LaunchPad Central. Due to the limited time for each team's presenations, there is not sufficient time to hear comments from the audiance out loud. Logging comments within LaunchPad Central supplies the additional benefit of having important feedback stored and accessable to the teams after class.
