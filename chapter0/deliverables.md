## Deliverables
1. A record of your customer discovery progress using LaunchPad Central to capture the narrative, contact information, learning and insight. This is also how progress is monitored.

2. A weekly, 10-minute presentation on your progress. Your weekly and final slide decks **should not contain any proprietary information**. They should focus on your business model and customer discovery. You will learn from looking at the presentations from past classes, and future Teams will learn from yours (final videos will be posted to YouTube)

3. Meaningful Customer Discovery requires the development of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). An MVP is a prototype that captures the minimum functionality. The Customer Discovery Process, a central element of the Lean LaunchPad approach to technology commercialization, requires development of a MVP so the Team can clearly communicate the product capability and value proposition. This process also helps focus the Team on what is and is not essential. Therefore, each team should have the applicable goal of the following:

  1. Teams building a physical product must have a bill of materials and a prototype.

  2. Teams building a web product must attempt to build the site, create demand and have customers using it. See:  [http://steveblank.com/2011/09/22/how-to-build-a-web-startup-lean-launchpad-edition/](http://steveblank.com/2011/09/22/how-to-build-a-web-startup-lean-launchpad-edition/) .
