## Course Roadmap

Each week’s class is organized around participants hypothesis-testing their business model assumptions outside the classroom:

* Talking to 10-15 customers.

* Capturing their Customer Discovery progress by using the [LaunchPad Central Platform](../platform.md) and updating their Business Model Canvas.

* Taking what they learned and assembling a 10-minute Lessons Learned Presentation.

* Engaging with their mentors.

* Attending mandatory office hours.

* Watching the lecture(s) for the week and preparing questions for discussion.

* Receiving comments and suggestions from other teams and the teaching team on the lessons learned.

### In the classroom

* Team presentations and instructor critiques.

* Q&A about what happened during the past week’s Discovery.

* Discussion about the online lecture you just watched on one of the nine building blocks of a business model to help prepare you for next week’s Discovery.

The work you will be presenting will be based on the lecture you watched the prior week. The lecture you watch just before classes, and the in-class lecture, will cover the upcoming week’s business model topic to prepare you for the discovery tasks for that week. That means we expect you to have watched that lecture prior to the class.

Each week you are expected to have an updated version of your entire Business Model Canvas, but your Customer Discovery should focus primarily on the topic from the previous class’s lecture and pre-class readings and videos.
