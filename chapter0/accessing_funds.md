# Accessing Funds

Each team is required to submit a set of documents to receive funding. This includes participation agreements, training award notices, and an approved budget. Once these documents are submitted and approved, an account will be set up under the PI's name. To access the funds, teams will need to work with the  Contracts and Grants contact assigned to the PI's department. For a list of contacts for each department in UCF, [click here](http://www.research.ucf.edu/Research/Administrators.html).

It is recommended that all teams keep copies of each of their receipts, purchase orders, invoices, and any other proof of purchase. A simple way to do this is to set up a folder, and keep a document with a list of all current expenses alongside pictures of each proof of purchase.
