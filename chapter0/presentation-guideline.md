## Guidelines for Team Presentations

Each team is expected to speak to at least 10-15 customers every week. The 10-minute weekly team presentations are summaries of the team’s findings during that week.

Each week, you are expected to have an updated version of your entire Business Model Canvas, but your Customer Discovery should focus primarily on the topic listed for the week, which was discussed at the end of previous class. This is true regardless of whether you’ve pivoted and are re-exploring topics from earlier lectures. In the case of a pivot (which can be indicative of successful Customer Discovery), you will have to work doubly hard to cover earlier class topics and touch on current class topics in your weekly presentation. **The format for slides will vary week to week**, however the *general* format is this:

### Slide 1: Cover slide

* Team name and logo

    * Team members/roles


* Number of customers spoken to this week

* Three sentence description about what the team does and why your audience should care

* Market Size (TAM – total addressable market, SAM – Serviceable Addressable Market,   TM – Target Market) did it change this week?
    * Exported from LaunchPad Central


### Slide 2: Updated Business Model Canvas 

* Week-to-week changes shown in red (Exported from LaunchPad Central)

* Multi-sided markets shown in different colors

### Slide 3 - What did you learn about

*"topic of the day" (Canvas block x)*

* Hypothesis: Here’s What we Thought

* Experiments: Here’s What we Did

* Results: Here’s What we Found

* Action: Here’s What we Are Going to Do Next

### Slide 4 – Diagram (if appropriate)

* Diagram of what you learned this week (e.g. customer workflow, payment flows, distribution channel diagram)

### Feeback
After each presenation. Teams will receive feedback from the Teaching Team. Feedback from the teaching team during oral presentations is where the most learning occurs. Due to the pace and tempo of the course, all course participants will be held accountable for completing the reading and video materials detailed in the syllabus covering the material for each class.
