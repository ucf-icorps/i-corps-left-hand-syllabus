## Help!

### What kind of support will our team have?

The teaching team consists of professors, a TA, and one mentor per team. A mentor is an experienced entrepreneur or venture capitalist assigned to your team. Theyâ€™ve volunteered to help with the course and your team because they love startups. Their job is to guide you as you get out of the building.

### How often can we/should we meet with our mentor?

Your mentor will join in the classroom every week. You can email them or meet with them more often if they have time.

### Can I talk to a mentor not assigned to my team?

 By all means, do so. All the mentors are happy to help. However they cannot support your team full time unless your mentor decides to swap places with them.

### I need help now.

Your first stop is your TAs. Email or sit down with them during the week if you have a problem. If you need something resolved sooner, email us on [icorps@ucf.edu](mailto:icorps@ucf.edu).

### Who are the mentors?

See the mentor list on the course website.

### Team Dynamics

What roles are in each team? Traditionally, each team member is part of the "customer development team." You have to figure out how to allocate the work.

### What if my team becomes dysfunctional?

Prepare to work through difficult issues. If the situation continues, approach the teaching team. Do not wait until the end of the course to raise the issue.

### What if one of my teammates is not "pulling his/her weight"?

Try to resolve it within your team. If the situation continues longer than a week, please approach the teaching team.
