## Attendance and Participation

* You cannot miss the first class without prior approval.

* This is very intense course with a very high workload. If you cannot commit to 15-20 hours a week outside the classroom, this course is not for you.

* There are no remote options for this course—you must take the course on campus.

* The startup culture at times can feel brusque and impersonal, but in reality is focused and oriented to create immediate action in time- and cash-constrained environments.

* If during the semester you find you cannot continue to commit the time, immediately notify your team members and teaching team and drop the course.

* If you expect to miss a class, please let the UCF I-Corps team and your team members know ahead of time via email.

* We expect your attention during our presentations and those of your fellows in the class.

* If you’re getting bored, tired, or inattentive, step outside for some air. If we see you reading email or browsing the web we will ask you to leave the class.

* We ask that you use a name card during every session of the quarter.

* During the other teams’ presentations you will be required to give feedback online via the LaunchPad Central system. Please bring a laptop to every class and be prepared to give your undivided attention to the team at the front of the room.
