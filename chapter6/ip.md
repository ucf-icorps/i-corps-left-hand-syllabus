## Intellectual Property

The UCF I-Corps Program has created a Participation Agreement to clarify concerns regarding intellectual property and the likes, and all participants need to sign one and return it to us. If you have any questions, please contact any from the team to discuss it further.

### The content of the Participation Agreement is written below

The I-Corps Site Program is offered by UCF to qualified applicants by invitation only ("Participants").  The Program consists of time spent in workshops as well as significant time interacting with industry. The Program is made possible by a grant from the National Science Foundation and there is no charge to Participants. Funding is made available according to terms of a participant award notice (“Award Notice”), and upon each Participant signed confirmation of the following:

1. Team  

    1. I understand that I have been assigned to a team, with each team made up of the following: one (1) Entrepreneurial Lead which may include but is not limited to a Postdoctoral scholar, graduate student, undergraduate or other student, or professional staff, with the relevant knowledge of the technology and a deep commitment to investigate the commercial landscape surrounding the innovation, one (1) Mentor who will typically be an experienced or emerging entrepreneur with proximity to the institution and experience in transitioning technology out of academic labs, and one (1) Academic Lead who will be responsible for overall project management (collectively, "Team Members").  I am participating as □ Entrepreneurial Lead, □ Mentor (Mentor participation is voluntary and I understand I will not receive any financial support.), □ Academic Lead.

2. Engagement

    2. For the terms set forth in the Award Notice, I agree to regularly attend and participate in scheduled I-Corps workshops with my Team Members. This includes completion of required reading and assignments. I will come prepared to take an active role in workshops and conduct myself in a manner that is professional, open and responsive to mentors and professionals working with the Program.  

3. Confidentiality

    3. During workshops, I may disclose my proprietary information or encounter information that is proprietary to other Participants. I agree to respect the confidential and proprietary information of others, and I expect the same courtesy from other Participants. I will use the same degree of care to protect other’s information as I do my own, and will make no use of other’s information without proper authorization.  UCF will not make unauthorized use of any Participant proprietary information, but UCF WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY BREACH OF THIS PROVISION BY ANY PARTICIPANT. Participant understands and accepts that Participant’s sole recourse for any breach of confidentiality by another Participant shall be against the breaching Participant. I understand and agree that no intellectual property rights of any kind are granted to UCF or any other Participant by me, and no intellectual property rights of any kind are received by my participation in this Program. (If I am a UCF employee, I understand that I remain obligated to UCF Regulation 2.029.)

4. Liability Release

    4. I acknowledge that instructors, speakers, mentors, and UCF can provide guidance, but that they cannot make business decisions on my behalf. Ultimately, I bear responsibility for my own business results.  UCF SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND. 

5. Reporting 

    5. The Program is subject to grant reporting requirements that are dependent upon my cooperation to ensure progress and quantify success. I agree to submit accurate information about my venture in a timely manner, and grant UCF the right to report my information to the Sponsor, as required.     

6. Acknowledgement & Release 

    6. UCF may use, reproduce and publish visual or audio materials, including reference to name, likeness, logo or website, that pertain to me and/or my venture in order to publicize or promote the service activities of UCF and the I-Corps Program.
